# ACAMP

Electron based app that plays music depending on the hour.
This project seeks to emulate the feature from the Animal Crossing games.

If you want to use this yourself, you will have to get the audio files yourself,
as I cannot leagally provide them here. 

You will need to create a "music" folder in the bin. and the structure will look like this.
